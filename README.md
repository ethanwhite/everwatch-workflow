# Download and clean Zooniverse annotations

To download the image crops and corresponding annotations
```
python aggregate.py
```
This saves the raw zooniverse data to 
```
/App/Zooniverse/data/everglades-watch-classifications.csv
```

followed by

```
python extract.py
```

which saves image crops and annotation shapefiles to

```
/orange/ewhite/everglades/Zooniverse/parsed_images/
```

# Bird-Bird-Bird Workflow

## Environment

Conda or mamba (faster)
```
mamba env create -f=environment.yml
```
The environment can be sensitive to the new CUDA version. Its often useful to first install torch and torch vision from -c pytorch and then install the rest of the environment. 

0. Sync dropbox to hipergator

```
rclone sync everglades2021:"Wading Bird 2021/Deliverables/" /orange/ewhite/everglades/2021
```

1. Predict bird locations using trained model using predict.py. If you need to train a new model see the [BirdDetectorRepo](https://github.com/weecology/BirdDetector/blob/main/everglades.py). To create the annotations for the bird detector model run [this](https://github.com/weecology/EvergladesWadingBird/blob/main/Zooniverse/create_bird_detector_annotations.py)

```
python Zooniverse/predict.py
```
This will run the everglades bird detector on all selected files in /orange/ewhite/everglades/2021 and save predicted bird locations to /orange/ewhite/everglades/predictions. A subset of sites can be selected using the find_files() function. An aggregate .shp of all bird detections is written this repo at

```
App/Zooniverse/data/PredictedBirds.shp
```
The output shapefile contains the predicted polygon, confidence score, site and event date.
```
>>> import geopandas as gpd
>>> gdf[["score","site","event"]]
          score     site       event
0      0.246132   Jerrod  03_24_2020
1      0.349666   Jerrod  03_24_2020
...         ...      ...         ...
14033  0.270656  Yonteau  04_27_2020
14034  0.237832  Yonteau  04_27_2020
```

2. Predict nest-locations using bird-bird-bird 

```
python Zooniverse/nest_detection.py
```

This will save nest series images to 

```
/orange/ewhite/everglades/nest_crops/
```
and a aggregate shapefile at 

```
/orange/ewhite/everglades/nest_crops/nest_detections.shp
```

The shapefile contains the predicted nest polygon, site, date and a unique identifier.
```
>>> gdf[["Site","Date","target_ind"]].head()
          Site        Date  target_ind
0        Aerie  04_27_2020         880
1        Aerie  04_27_2020         880
2  CypressCity  03_11_2020           7
3  CypressCity  04_29_2020           7
4  CypressCity  04_01_2020           8
```
